targets:
  # This covers the basic example; an enabled
  # webhook with no auth, using all the other defaults.
  # This will retry 3 times on failure, and request timeout
  # is 10 seconds
  - name: "Basic webhook to echo server"
    webhook:
      url: "http://localhost:9147/echo"

  # This example explicitly sets the retries to 5, and
  # sets the timeout to 30 seconds instead of 10,
  # which is useful if we expect this target to be
  # more flaky than others.
  - name: "Basic webhook with retries"
    webhook:
      url: "http://localhost:9147/echo"
      retries: 5
      timeout: 30

  # This example uses basic authentication. The username
  # is hardcoded, but the password is pulled from an
  # environment variable at runtime. It is recommended
  # to use environment variables for sensitive data,
  # and to not store them in the config file, but this
  # is not enforced; you can hardcode the password if
  # you want.
  - name: "Webhook using basic auth"
    webhook:
      url: "http://localhost:9147/echo"
      auth:
        username: "pixy"
        # This value is pulled from the environment variable
        # `PIXY_PASSWORD`
        password: "{{ env.PASSWORD }}"

  # This example uses bearer authentication. The token
  # is pulled from an environment variable at runtime.
  # It is recommended to use environment variables for
  # sensitive data, and to not store them in the config
  # file, but this is not enforced; you can hardcode the
  # token if you want.
  - name: "Webhook using bearer auth"
    webhook:
      url: "http://localhost:9147/echo"
      auth:
        # This value is pulled from the environment variable
        # `PIXY_TOKEN`
        token: "{{ env.TOKEN }}"

  # This is a second example of a webhook using bearer auth,
  # but using a different environment variable for the token.
  # You can use as many different environment variables as
  # you want, provided that they use different names and
  # start with `PIXY_`.
  - name: "Second webhook using bearer auth and environment variables"
    webhook:
      url: "http://localhost:9147/echo"
      auth:
        # This value is pulled from the environment variable
        # `PIXY_OTHER_TOKEN`
        token: "{{ env.OTHER_TOKEN }}"
