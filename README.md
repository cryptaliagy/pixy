This is a template repository meant to be used as a starting point for developing a new Rust-based microservice. This handles most of the key bootstrapping elements that I require when creating a new service.

## How to use

1. Create a new repository templated from this repo
1. Use a global find + replace (CTRL+SHIFT+H on VSCode) to replace `"websvc"` with the name of your service
1. Use a global find + replace to replace `"WEBSVC"` with the capitalized name of your service. This is used in the `config.rs` file.
   > Note, if your service name uses dashes in its name, you will need to replace `<service>-<name>` with `<service>_<name>` in `main.rs` and use underscores in the capitalized version

## Features

### Service

1. Configuration from environment variables
1. Access log / request profiler (optional)
1. `rocket`-based web service
1. Logging setup with `fern`
1. Debug route (conditionally compiled)
1. Heartbeat route (for checking service health)

### Infrastructure

1. A minimal binary for health checks
   - Running `healthcheck` while the service is running should return a status code 0 if the service is healthy, 1 otherwise
   - This is used in the Dockerfile for integrated healthchecks, but can also be used in kubernetes
1. A multipart `Dockerfile` for:
   - Development, with all build tools & code available as the first stage
   - Building, compiling the prod release binary
   - Debug, an `alpine` container that includes the binaries, a shell, and a package manager
   - Prod, a `scratch` container that includes exclusively the compiled binaries.
1. A `docker-compose` file.
1. A `justfile` with basic commands. For more information on [`just`](https://just.systems), see their website.
   > NOTE: this is added for convenience to make calling the compose commands a little faster. I personally believe there is a lot of value in knowing how these things work at a high level, or at minimum knowing how to call these docker commands yourself. As such, any `just` command will also print off what it runs before running it.

### CI/CD

1. PR / Testing pipeline with:
   - Security scanning
   - Linting with Clippy
   - Cargo tests (debug + release)
1. A container publishing pipeline for main branch:
   - Publishes Prod + Debug container to github packages
   - Major & Minor version tracked through `VERSION` file
   - Patch version tracked through pipeline
1. A nightly (and manually-runnable) pipeline for security scanning that:
   - Scans the `latest`/`latest-gnu`/`debug`/`debug-gnu` containers in the registry
   - Builds all deployed container targets and scans them at the current SHA
   - Runs the `cargo audit` security scan for cargo dependencies

### Benchmarks & Performance

Since this is a demo service with only two routes (one in production), there is no service benchmarks offered. However, I've done some very basic benchmarking of image size and runtime memory cost of the images for curiosity's sake.

As of 27-02-2023, these are the stats (with, of course, some variability):

| Image   | Image Size | Running Memory After Startup | Running Memory After 1k Requests |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| dev     | 4.53 GB    | 1.332 MiB                    | 1.52 MiB                         |
| builder | 5.3 GB     | 1.324 MiB                    | 1.516 MiB                        |
| debug   | 12.1 MB    | 932 KiB                      | 1.16 MiB                         |
| prod    | 5.06 MB    | 924 KiB                      | 1.23 MiB                         |

Additionally, I make some performance guarantees about service runtime as part of a test in [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs): The heartbeat route, under default configurations, should execute < 1 ms using the debug profile, and < 200 μs in release profile. This should hold relatively well even under more performance-constrained machines since Rust is very performant and the code is very simple; under my machine (i7-1185G7 @ 3.00GHz), `/heartbeat` requests took ~200 μs under debug and ~20-50 μs under release configurations.

Requests were run using the following python script:

```py
import asyncio
import httpx


async def query(n: int = 1000):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        for _ in range(n):
            await client.get("http://localhost:8000/heartbeat")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys

    arg = sys.argv[1:]

    if len(arg) > 1:
        print("Invalid arg")
        sys.exit(1)

    arg = 1000 if len(arg) == 0 else int(arg[0])

    asyncio.run(query(arg))
```

### Why `scratch`?

The decision to use scratch is 3-fold:

1. Smallest possible binary. The final prod image contains only the resulting binary, which allows it to be incredibly small (~4 mb)
1. Reduce attack surface. There's nothing additional in the container to exploit than the service itself.
1. Reduce container scanning false-positives. With nothing other than the binary in the image, you will never get a security scanner complaint due to an unused dependency, since
   no unused dependencies are bundled in.

### Why include a `debug` container?

Depending on the circumstance, it can still be useful to debug the application using additional tools that I haven't thought of or pre-packaged. The debug container based on `alpine` allows installation of additional debugging tools, but I don't really think it'll come up much. Most debugging / testing should be done in the `dev` container that contains a full suite of rust tools and the actual source code.
